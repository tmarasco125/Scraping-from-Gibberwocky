And the pensive Spirit of Pity whispered, “Why?” To nightmare-men in millions when they slept.
Of night a boom came thencewise, like the dull plunge of a stone dropped into some deep well. So, when old hopes that earth was bettering slowly
Were dead and damned, there sounded 'War is done!' Aye; all was hushed. They hail me as one living, But don't they know That I have died of late years, Untombed although? The beats of being raging
In me like fire. That night your great guns, unawares, Shook all our coffins as we lay. The mouse let fall the altar-crumb,
the worms drew back into the mounds. The world is as it used to be. The land's sharp features seemed to be
the Century's corpse outleant. So little cause for carolings  of such ecstatic sound, was written on terrestrial things afar or nigh around.
